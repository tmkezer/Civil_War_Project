# Civil_War_Project

For this project, our group decided to focus on the current political and social landscape and chronicle the removal of civil war monuments nationwide.

The two Data soruces we used in this project are The Historical Markers Database's collection of Civil War monuments and the Southern Poverty Law Center's whose heitage is it anyway dataset.

We then linked the two visuals, Monument locations and Monuments erected over time, to each dataset, allowing the user to choose which data they would like to examine.

In this project we used Python, JS, CSS, and HTML. We hosted the application via Flask and stored our data with MongoDB.
